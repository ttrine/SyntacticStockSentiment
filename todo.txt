- Devising the controls

	- Use S-Space to generate unigram and bigram word spaces
	
	- Run test set through it to generate the vectors
		- Output a matrix of these vectors
		- Add the class labels as the last column

	- Use WEKA to train a NB and SVM from each of these spaces
		- Sift through the RNTN training params and replicate them as closely as possible, noting divergences

- Estimate model accuracies
	- Use labeled.txt and splitDict.txt to generate testTweets.txt
	- Run it through all da models
	- Load each such vector in R and measure model accuracies
